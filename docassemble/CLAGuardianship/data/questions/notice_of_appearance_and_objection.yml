      <h2 class="h4">Your explanation</h2>
      If you are ready, you can explain **now** why you disagree with the guardianship petition in
      the interests of ${ children[0].familiar() }. Your answer has to be based on facts that you know.

      ${ collapse_template(objections_explanation_template) }

      You must sign your objection under the pains and penalties of perjury. This means that you are swearing that everything you wrote is true. 
      A judge can punish you if you lie in your objection. Lying will also affect if a judge believes you later on.

      If you aren’t ready to make your explanation now, you can still file your objection now. However, you must file your explanation with the court within 30 days of the return date.

  What can I say?
content: |
  You can object to the guardianship for any reason that you believe is true.

  For example, you may disagree because:

  * ${ children[0].familiar() } does not need a guardian
  * The person who wants to be the guardian has a conflict of interest or may not
    manage ${ children[0].familiar() }'s money properly
