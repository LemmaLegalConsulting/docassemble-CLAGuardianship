id: sureties waiver
question: |
  Waiving the **surety** requirement
subquestion: |
  When a judge appoints a guardian, they require the guardian to sign a **bond**
  to the court and name someone as a **surety**. The bond is a personal guarantee. 
  It is a promise that the guardian will manage the money and property of the ward responsibly.

  The **surety** is a person who promises to pay the court if the guardian does not manage the money
  or property the way that they should. The surety can be someone other than the guardian.

  [More about surety bonds](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/guardians/court-appointment)
  (opens in a new tab).

  When the guardian is for a minor, the surety requirement is often waived, or skipped.
  This is because the guardian does not have control over the minor's money or property.

  You can ask the judge to skip the surety requirement now.

  - I want permission to skip the **surety** requirement: wants_sureties_waiver
