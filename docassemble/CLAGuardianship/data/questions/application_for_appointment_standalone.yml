  description: |-
    If you are the **parent** of a child who is part of a guardianship case,
    you can use this interview to ask the court to give you a lawyer.

    This interview will ask you questions about the child, the court case,
    and your contact information.

    There is a fee of $150 to get a lawyer in a guardianship case, but 
    if you cannot afford it, you can ask the court to waive the fee.
