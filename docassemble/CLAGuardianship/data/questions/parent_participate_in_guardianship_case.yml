    Parent's Consent or Objection to a Minor Guardianship
  description: |-
    This interview helps a Massachusetts parent or someone else who cares about the wellbeing of a minor
    attend and have a chance to talk to the judge in a minor guardianship case. 
    
    It can help the parent or other person:

    * Tell the judge they disagree (object) to the guardianship, or
    * Tell the judge they agree (consent) to the guardianship.

    If you want to be heard but do not yet know if you agree or disagree, you can use this 
    interview to ask the judge to let you speak at the hearing.

    It can also help the parent ask the judge to give them a lawyer for the case.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    You can use this interview if:

    * You are a parent of the minor in the guardianship case, or
    * You are someone else who cares about the minor's wellbeing, and
    * Someone has filed a case in court for the guardianship of a child.

    The case to get a guardian for the minor has to already be filed with 
    the court.
  before_you_start: |
    Before you start, you should have the court papers for the guardianship case.

    If you do not have the papers, you need to know:

    * The date the case was filed
    * The docket number for the case
    * The name of the court where the case was filed

    You may be able to find this information on [masscourts.org](https://www.masscourts.org/).

  You need to sign your form in front of a notary public

subquestion: |
  Because you are agreeing to the guardianship, you need to **sign** your
  form in front a notary public.

  We will not get your signature yet. Do not sign it until you are in 
  front of the notary public.

  You may be able to find a notary for free at your bank, town hall, or local library.

  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.

  Otherwise, you will need to print your forms and sign them by hand.

  Participate as a parent in your child's guardianship case
subquestion: |
  If someone has filed a case in court for the guardianship of your child, you can use
  this interview to say that you want to participate in the case or that you agree
  to your child getting a guardian.

  This interview can make up to 5 documents:

  * A "Waiver and Consent" form, or
  * A "Notice of Appearance and Objection", and
  * An affidavit, if you disagree with the guardianship, and
  * Optionally, a request to get an attorney to help you in court, and
  * A fee waiver to show the judge if you can pay for the attorney.

  The interview will help you decide which documents you need.

  It takes most people between 10-15 minutes to finish this interview.
