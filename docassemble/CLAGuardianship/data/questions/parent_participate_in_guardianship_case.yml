  Because you are agreeing to the guardianship, you need to **sign** your
  form in front a notary public.

  front of the notary public.

  You may be able to find a notary for free at your bank, town hall, or local library.

  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |

  Otherwise, you will need to print your forms and sign them by hand.

question: |
  Participate as a parent in your child's guardianship case
subquestion: |
  If someone has filed a case in court for the guardianship of your child, you can use
  this interview to say that you want to participate in the case or that you agree
  to your child getting a guardian.

  This interview can make up to 5 documents:

  * A "Waiver and Consent" form, or
  * A "Notice of Appearance and Objection", and
  * An affidavit, if you disagree with the guardianship, and
  * Optionally, a request to get an attorney to help you in court, and
  * A fee waiver to show the judge if you can pay for the attorney.

  The interview will help you decide which documents you need.

  It takes most people between 10-15 minutes to finish this interview.

subquestion: |
  Normally, there is a fee of $150 to get a lawyer in a guardianship

  If you want the court to pay for a lawyer, you must fill out a fee waiver form.
  We can help you make the fee waiver form too.
