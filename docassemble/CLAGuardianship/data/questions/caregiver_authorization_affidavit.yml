  What are the limits of your permission?
subquestion: |
  You can limit both:

  1. Length of the permission, and
  2. The powers of the caregiver

  You must choose an ending date for the permission.

  You can choose any date up to 2 years from the day you sign this document.

  Limiting the powers is optional. If you do not write a limit, the caregiver
  will have permission to make all decisions about healthcare and education for the length
  of the permission.
  % else:
  You can choose any date up to 60 days from the day you sign this document.

  Limiting the powers is optional. If you do not write a limit, the caregiver
  will have permission to make **all** decisions that you can make as a parent for
  the length of the permission, except for decisions about adoption.

      some medical decisions.
