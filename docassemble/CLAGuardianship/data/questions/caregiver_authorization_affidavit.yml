    Caregiver authorization
  description: |-
    This interview helps a parent or guardian in Massachusetts give temporary permission to someone to 
    make medical and educational decisions for their child. The parent does not lose their
    rights to make decisions for their child.

    You may want to use this interview if you are unable to care for your child for a short period of time,
    up to 60 days or 2 years, depending on the kind of permission you need to give.

    It can make either a **caregiver authorization affidavit** or the **temporary agent affidavit**,
    depending on which kind of permission you want to give.

    This form does not need to be filed with the court. It must be signed in front of a notary and two witnesses.    
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    Any parent or guardian in Massachusetts can use this form to give temporary permission to someone to make medical and educational decisions for their child.

    You can use this form to give permission to a trusted adult to make:

    * Medical decisions and 
    * Educational decisions, for up to 2 years
    
    or
    
    * Some other decisions, including decisions over where your child lives and property, for up to 60 days
  before_you_start: |

  * There are no court orders in effect that would prohibit me from exercising or conferring the rights and responsibilities that I wish to confer upon the caregiver. 
    (If you are the legal guardian or custodian, attach the court order appointing you.)
  * I am not using this affidavit to circumvent any state or federal law, for the purposes of attendance at a particular school, or to re-confer rights to a caregiver from whom those rights have been removed by a court of law.
  * I confer these rights and responsibilities freely and knowingly in order to provide for ${ children[0].familiar() if len(children.complete_elements()) > 0 else f"the minor" } and not as a result of pressure, threats or payments by any person or agency.
  * I understand that, if the affidavit is amended or revoked, I must provide the amended affidavit or revocation to all parties to whom I have provided this affidavit.

  What are the limits of your permission?

  You can decide how much power you want the caregiver to have. You can limit both:

  1. The length of the permission, and
  2. The powers of the caregiver

  You must choose an ending date for the permission. 
  % if permission_kind == "caregiver authorization affidavit":
  You can choose any date up to 2 years from the day you sign this document.

  Limiting the powers is optional. If you do not write a limit, the caregiver
  will have permission to make all decisions about healthcare and education for the length
  of the permission.
  % else:
  You can choose any date up to 60 days from the day you sign this document.

  Limiting the powers is optional. If you do not write a limit, the caregiver
  will have permission to make **all** decisions that you can make as a parent for
  the length of the permission, except for decisions about adoption.

  # - note: |
  #     **Length of Caregiver's Permission** 
      
  #     First, you must choose a date for the caregiver's permission to end. The permission 
  #     can last for up to **two years** from the date that the affidavit is signed.
  #     You can also end this permission sooner if you need by sending the caregiver a written
  #     note. Limiting the powers is optional. If you do not write a limit, the caregiver
  #     will have permission to make all decisions about healthcare and education for the length
  #     of the permission. 
      
  #     When do you want the caregiver’s permission to expire?
      
  #     **Limits to the Caregiver's Permission**

  #     Second, you may decide what specific things you do not want the caregiver to do. 
  #     For example, you could write that the caregiver is not allowed to make decisions 
  #     about your child’s mental health treatment. You don’t have to limit the 
  #     caregiver’s permission.
  #     **limit** what the caregiver can do. For example, you can stop the caregiver 
  #     from making some medical decisions. If you don’t, the caregiver will have permission 
  #     to make all decisions about your child’s healthcare and education. You can always 
  #     change what permission the caregiver has later by sending the caregiver a written note.

  #     What decisions do you not want the caregiver to make for your child?
