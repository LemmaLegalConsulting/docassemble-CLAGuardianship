question: |
  Military Affidavit
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you fill out a Military Affidavit,
  which declares whether anybody who is part of this case is
  currently serving in a branch of the U.S. military.

  If someone is in the military, they may have special
  protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.

  This affidavit has to be filed even if none of the parties are
  in the military right now.

  Use the best information you know. But you must explain either that:

  * you know the military status of each party, or 
  * you searched the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act website](https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/)
    to find out their military status

  What is military service?
content: |
  Under 50 U.S.C. § 3931, which is part of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), the term "military service" is defined broadly to include the following:

  1. Members of the armed forces on active duty.

  This refers to individuals serving full time in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including those in the Reserves and National Guard when called to active duty.
  
  2. Members of the National Guard on service under a call to active service for more than 30 consecutive days.

  This includes National Guard members who are called to active duty by the President or the Secretary of Defense for emergencies, wars, or other national defense needs.

  3. Commissioned officers of the Public Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on active service.

  These commissioned officers are also considered to be in "military service" when performing their duties.

  Someone who is otherwise in active service but is currently absent because of sickness, injury, leave, or other lawful cause is still considered to be in active military service.

subject: |
  What is the bond for?
content: |
  If you are unsure about the military status of any party in this case, the judge may require you to pay a bond to protect the party's rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.

  The bond is money that you pay to the court. If the party is in the military, the bond will protect their rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. 
  If the party is not in the military, the bond will be returned to you.

  The bond is only required if the other party does not show up in court
  and loses "by default".
