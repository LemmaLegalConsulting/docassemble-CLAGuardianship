  What is a surety and when is one required?
content: |
  **What is a surety?**

  When a judge picks a new guardian for a minor, that person has to promise to take good care of the minor's money and property. 
  Sometimes, the guardian needs to also choose someone else that agrees to pay the court back if the minor's money or property are not managed well. **This person is called a surety**. 

  **When is a surety needed?**

  Sureties are **not usually required**, since most minors do not have money or property to be managed.
  In these cases, **the court will likely waive (or skip) the requirement**.

  However, **if the minor *does* have money or property**, a surety will likely be needed. 
  For example, this can happen when the minor has inherited money or property from a relative that passed away.
