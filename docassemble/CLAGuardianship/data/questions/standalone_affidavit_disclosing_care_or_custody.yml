    Child Care or Custody Disclosure Affidavit
  short title: |
    Child Care or Custody Disclosure
  description: |
    You can use this interview to make an Child Care or Custody Disclosure Affidavit to
    tell the judge about:

    * Any other cases that the child or children are in now
    * Any other cases that the child has been in before
    * The names of the people, like the child's parents, who are involved in those cases
    * The names of attorneys, guardians ad litem, or other people who are involved in those cases

    The form that this interview makes may already be included in other interviews on this site.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    If you are asking a judge to make a decision about the custody or guardianship of a child,
    the judge needs to know about any **other** cases involving the child. This helps the judge
    know if another judge has already made an order about who can take care of the child.

    Any person who is part of a family law case or a case about protection from abuse
    can use this form to tell the judge what they know about other cases involving the child or children.
  before_you_start: |
    Before you start, you may want to gather information about:

    * The names of the children who are part of the case
    * The names of the other people who are involved in the case
    * The names of the attorneys or other people who are involved in the case
    * The names of the courts where the case is happening

    In some cases, you may want to use the [MassCourts](https://masscourts.org) website to find
    more about cases that have to do with the children.
