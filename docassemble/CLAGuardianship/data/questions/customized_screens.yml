  Do you want the court to pay for a lawyer for you?

  Because you are ${ children[0] }'s parent, you have the right
  to have the court give you a lawyer.

  Normally, there is a fee of $150 to get a lawyer in a guardianship
  case. You can ask the court to waive the fee if you cannot afford it.

  The court needs to know about any other cases to decide:

  * Who needs to get notice of this case
  * If there are any other court orders that might affect this case

  The answer to these questions will be used to make your **Affidavit Disclosing Care or Custody Proceedings**.

question: |
  Do you need a temporary guardian for ${ children[0].familiar() }?
subquestion: |
  It can take time for a judge to appoint a guardian. If you
  need a guardian right away, you can ask a judge for a temporary
  guardian. A judge can make someone a temporary guardian in as little as 7 days.

  The temporary guardian can be the same person as the permanent guardian. 

  You can ask for a temporary guardian if waiting for a permanent guardian would risk 
  **substantial harm** to ${ children[0].familiar() if len(children.complete_elements()) > 0 else f"the minor" }'s:

  * health,
  * safety, or
  * wellbeing

  And no other person has authority to act in the circumstances.

  In some parts of Massachusetts, the judge will make you ask for
  a temporary guardian even if you are able to wait. For that reason,
  most people answer "yes".

  - Do you want the judge to appoint a temporary guardian?: requested_temporary_guardians.there_are_any
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - note: |
      <h2 class="h4">Why do you need a temporary guardian?</h2>

      Answer each of the following questions in a few sentences. It is OK to repeat
      the same reasons that you wrote about why you need a **permanent** guardian.
