id: wants attorney
question: |
  Do you want the court to pay for a lawyer for you?
subquestion: |
  Because you are ${ children[0] }'s parent, you have the right
  to have the court give you a lawyer.

  Normally, there is a fee of $150 to get a lawyer in a guardianship
  case. You can ask the court to waive the fee if you cannot afford it.  
fields: 
  - Do you want a lawyer: parent_wants_lawyer
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I ask for permission not to pay the counsel fee: waiver_fee
    datatype: yesnoradio
    show if: parent_wants_lawyer

question: |
  Affidavit Disclosing Care or Custody Proceedings
subquestion: |
  % if who_is_making_petition == "minor":
  The next set of questions are about any other court cases that involve **you**.
  % else:
  The next set of questions are about any other court cases that involve **${ children.familiar() }**.
  % endif

  The court needs to know about any other cases to decide:

  * Who needs to get notice of this case
  * If there are any other court orders that might affect this case

  The answer to these questions will be used to make your **Affidavit Disclosing Care or Custody Proceedings**.
