id: wants attorney
question: |
  Do you want the court to pay for a lawyer for you?
subquestion: |
  Because you are ${ children[0] }'s parent, you have the right
  to have the court give you a lawyer.

  Normally, there is a fee of $150 to get a lawyer in a guardianship
  case. You can ask the court to waive the fee if you cannot afford it.  
fields: 
  - Do you want a lawyer: parent_wants_lawyer
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I ask for permission not to pay the counsel fee: waiver_fee
